# Beautiful Soup Practice

This repository is intended for exploration and practice with Beatiful Soup.  In this example, it will be scraping product data from Backcountry.com.  There are limitations within using Beatiful Soup for scraping data from dynamically created pages, so the repository **Selenium** will go further into depth on collecting data from multiple pages for a larger collection of data, more practice, and implimentation in my PriceComparison project.

# Where to start  

After cloning the project, install the requirements into you virtual environment. To run the project using python:
```bash
python app.py
```

If you would like to select a different Backcountry.com web page to source from, you will need to replace the *URL* value in *app.py* for each page request.  As mentioned before, the **Selenium** repository will have more time spent on functionality due to dynamic rendering on Backcountry.com's website.
